# Train-Activity-Basic

Features:

1. User can enter train activity in the "Add Train" section. On clicking on the "Submit" button, the train activity information will be populated 
in the above table.

2. The application is using firebase as database to store information real time.

3. Use moment library to convert time to calcalable minutes

4. Trying to work on a bonus feature deleting a row. The button is there, but haven't figured it out yet. Will push the work if done.

* note that firebase doesn't like "date/time" data type, therefore it needs to covert to string or number to store. Great learn! :-)
